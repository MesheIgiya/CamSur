<center></li><h1>HISTORY</h1></li></center>
<p><li>The history of Camarines Sur is an amalgam of cross-sectoral developments and external influences. Folklore and scientific researches have it that, thousands of years ago, there was a wendering tribe of Tabon men inhabiting a vast area of verdant, fertile plains and rolling hills. The gentle, cave-dwelling Tabon families developed a common culture and called themselves Ibalon, while they called their land a bounty Tiera de Ibalon. The name used to refer to the entire island of Luzon, but later was adopted to refer to Kabikolan Region. The name Kabikolan was derived from the word biko, meaning bent, crooked, or twisted, denoting the plase along the Bicol River's meandering course.The first recorded account of Camarines Sur's discovery by the Spaniards was in 1569 when Captain Luis Enriquez de Guzman and Fr. Alfonso Gimenez first explored the province.
In 1571, the Spanish Conquistador Juan de Salcedo, grandson of Miguil Lopez de Legazpi, came to the Bicol Region from the North. Two years later, in 1573, Juan de Salcedo led his troops in penetrating and exploring the peninsula as far as Santiago de Libon in search for spices, gold, and other precious stone.</p></li>
